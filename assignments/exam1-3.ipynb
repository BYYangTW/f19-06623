The large negative exponential is a fast changing function compared to the quadratic term, which suggests this is a stiff differential equation.

An alternative approach is the *backward Euler formula*, which tends to be more accurate for stiff systems. If we have $y' = f(x, y)$ and an initial condition, then we can estimate the next value using this formula:\n",
