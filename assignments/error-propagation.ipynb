If the model is: $f(x) = \\frac{a x}{b + x}$ and it is given that $a = 1.33 \\pm 0.01$ and $b = 0.03 \\pm 0.001$. The uncertainty in the prediction of $f(x)$ can be estimated as\n\n$\\sigma_f = \\sqrt{(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a})^2 \\sigma_a^2 + (\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b})^2 \\sigma_b^2}$\n\nevaluated at the point you want to make a prediction on. Use these formulas to estimate $f(5)$ and the 95% confidence  $f(5)$. Note that you should get a similar answer as what is in the lecture notes. You do not need to use the Student t-table in this problem, just estimate $\\sigma_f$ and with that a 95% confidence interval.\n\nI recommend that you try to use `scipy.misc.derivative`, but you can also derive the partial derivatives by hand if you prefer.\n\nProvide a discussion comparing this approach to the one in the lecture notes, including one advantage and one disadvantage of each approach.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"org":{"ASSIGNMENT":"error-propagation","POINTS":"2","CATEGORY":"homework","RUBRIC":"default","RUBRIC_CATEGORIES":"technical, presentation","RUBRIC_WEIGHTS":"0.9, 0.1","DUEDATE":"2019-10-18 23:59:59","GRADER":"Mingjie Liu"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
