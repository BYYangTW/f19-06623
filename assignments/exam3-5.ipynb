In this approach, you start with the current value, and predict the next value. Then, a correction is applied to the prediction to make it more accurate.\n\nSuppose we have an initial value ODE as $y' = f(t, y), y(t_0) = y_0$ and we denote the step size to take as $h$.\n\nWe can make a prediction step to obtain an intermediate estimate using the Euler method as:\n\n$\\widetilde{y}_{i+1} = y_i + h f(t_i, y_i)$\n\nThen, we make a correction step by using the trapezoid rule as:\n\n$y_{i + 1} = y_i + \\frac{1}{2} * h * [f(t_i, y_i) + f(t_{i+1}, \\widetilde{y}_{i + 1})]$\n\nLet $y'(t, y) = -y, y(0) = 1.0$.\n\nImplement the predictor-corrector scheme above to find $y(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=1$ using a step size of $h=0.1$. Compare your answer to the solution found using `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"org":{"ASSIGNMENT":"exam3-5","POINTS":"3","CATEGORY":"final-exam","RUBRIC":"default","RUBRIC_CATEGORIES":"technical, presentation","RUBRIC_WEIGHTS":"0.9, 0.1","DUEDATE":"2019-12-10 20:30:00","GRADER":"Yilin Yang"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
