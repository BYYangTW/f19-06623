Each city has a demand for arrays, and each factory has a limited supply to ship to them. It costs each factory a specific amount to ship to each city. Your goal is to figure out how many arrays each factory should ship to each city in a way that meets the demand, does not exceed the available supply for each factory, and that minimizes the total cost of shipping. The following table shows the cost to ship an array from a factory to a city, and the available supply at each factory, and demand in each city.\n\n| |New York|Chicago|Detroit|Milwaukee|Minnesota|Cleveland|Supply|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| A|10.8|9.1|12.5|15.5|13.8|14.3|160|\n| B|13.2|15.6|13.2|13.4|12.8|17.1|85|\n| C|14.4|14.6|13.4|15.2|13.6|13.9|320|\n| Demand|70|39|42|25|55|28||\n\nThere are 18 variables, $x_{ij}$ which are the number of arrays to send from factory $i$ to city $j$. The sum of $x_{ij}$ over $i$ represents the total number of arrays sent from a factory, and this must be less than or equal to the supply for that factory. The sum of $x_{ij}$ over $j$ represents the number of arrays sent to a city, and this must be greater than or equal to the demand for that city. The cost of shipping is the sum of $costs_{ij} * x_{ij}$ where the multiplication is elementwise. It is also true that $x_{ij}$ must be greater than or equal to zero.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n\ndemand = np.array([70, 39, 42, 25, 55, 28])\nsupply = np.array([160, 85, 320])\n\ncosts = np.array([[10.8, 9.1, 12.5, 15.5, 13.8, 14.3],\n                  [13.2, 15.6, 13.2, 13.4, 12.8, 17.1],\n                  [14.4, 14.6, 13.4, 15.2, 13.6, 13.9]])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Print your solution in a readable way, and show that the constraints are met.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"org":{"ASSIGNMENT":"exam3-1","POINTS":"4","CATEGORY":"final-exam","RUBRIC":"default","RUBRIC_CATEGORIES":"technical, presentation","RUBRIC_WEIGHTS":"0.9, 0.1","DUEDATE":"2019-12-10 20:30:00","GRADER":"John Kitchin"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
