This can be computed as:\n\n$k_i = P_i / P$ where $P_i = 10^{A_i + \\frac{B_i}{T +C_i}}$ and that pressure is in mmHg, and the temperature is in degrees Celsius.\n\nAs the batch distillation progresses, the temperature changes in a way that $k_1(T) x_1 + k_2(T) x_2 = 1$, which is an algebraic constraint, with the additional relationship that $1 = x_1 + x_2$. In the homework, a differential equation was derived for the dependence of $T$ on $x_2$. We will consider an alternative approach here.  We define an *error* $\\epsilon = 1 - k1 * x1 + k2 * x2$, and then we define a differential equation to change $T$ in a way that makes this error go to zero. We do this by multiplying the error by a proportionality constant that is large enough give an approximate equality in the constraint. For this problem you can choose $K_c = 0.5 \\times 10^6$. Note this means when the error is positive, that the temperature is too low, so it gets driven up, and when it is negative, the temperature is too high, so it gets driven down.\n\n$\\frac{dT}{dx_2} = K_c \\epsilon$\n\nThe following information is given:\n\nThe total pressure is fixed at 1.2 atm, and the distillation starts at $x_2=0.4$ and an initial temperature of 95.6 degrees Celsius.
