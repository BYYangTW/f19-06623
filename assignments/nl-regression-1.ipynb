The Hill's slope refers to the steepness of the curve (can be positive or negative) at the inflection point.\n-   **c:** Inflection point. The inflection point is defined as the point on the curve where the curvature changes direction or signs. $c$ is the dose where $y=(d-a)/2$.\n-   **d:** Maximum asymptote. In a bioassay where you have a standard curve, this can be thought of as the response value for infinite standard concentration.\n\nUse this data to find values for $a, b, c, d$ and the confidence interval for each parameter.
