This describes the viscosity of molten polystyrene at 453K. Our goal is to find the velocity profile between the plates.\n\nYou cannot solve this problem with `scipy.integrate.solve_bvp` because the viscosity depends on the derivative, and it is not possible to solve for the derivative as a function of only $y, v_x$. Instead, you have to use finite differences to discretize the problem and then solve the corresponding nonlinear algebra equations.\n\nTo estimate the derivative at each grid point, you should use the centered difference formula, which assumes a uniform spacing between the $y$ points of $h$:\n\n$\\frac{dv_x}{dy} \\approx \\frac{v_x[i + 1] - v_x[i - 1]}{2 h}$\n\nFor the initial guess, you can use the analytical solution for a Newtonian fluid:\n\n$v_x(y) = \\frac{y (y - B)}{2 \\eta_0}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\Delta x}\\right)$.\n\nFind a solution to the BVP that shows the velocity of the fluid between the two plates.
